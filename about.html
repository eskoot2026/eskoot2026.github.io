                <p class="lead intro-lead">
                Eskoot is a mobility safety team focused on reducing accidents in
                e-scooters and micromobility through real-time, on-device hazard detection.
                We believe safer streets start with better awareness. Using real-time terrain analysis, our module detects micro-hazards and 
                delivers non-intrusive haptic alerts, allowing riders to react before accidents happen.
                <br><b>Join us in bringing millions of e-scooter riders to their home safely!</b>

    </div>

    <div class="missionItem">
      <h3>Growing hazard intelligence</h3>
      <p>
        Build a continuously growing hazard dataset that helps shared e-scooter
        operators better understand and reduce road risks.

    </div>

    <div class="missionItem">
      <h3>Impact at city scale</h3>
      <p>
        Deliver Eskoot’s safety module to large e-scooter companies worldwide,

      We envision Eskoot as a solution that fundamentally improves safety in micromobility.
      By reducing crashes caused by poor road conditions, Eskoot helps make e-scooter
      transportation safer, more reliable, and more widely accepted in urban environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Safety and sustainability are core values of our mission. Eskoot continuously
      reuses and learns from collected hazard data to improve performance over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the long term, our goal is to enable safer infrastructure by providing a
      platform where shared e-scooter companies and municipalities gain a deeper
      understanding of road conditions.
