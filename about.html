                <p class="lead intro-lead">
                Eskoot is a mobility safety team focused on reducing accidents in
                e-scooters and micromobility through real-time, on-device hazard detection.
                We believe safer streets start with better awareness. Using real-time terrain analysis, our module detects micro-hazards and 
                delivers non-intrusive haptic alerts, allowing riders to react before accidents happen.
                <br><b>Join us in bringing millions of e-scooter riders to their home safely!</b>

            Eskoot began with a simple observation: most scooter accidents aren’t
            caused by reckless riding, but by invisible road conditions.
            Potholes, cracks, and uneven pavement appear suddenly — especially at night.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
            We set out to build a compact, affordable module that could detect
            these hazards instantly and warn riders before it’s too late.
